This is a collection of project labs for CS120.  They were written in Spark 1.62 and python 2.6, running the code under spark 2.0 and above may cause some issues with the handling of rdd to DF conversion.  The notebooks were created and ran on databricks community edition which can be found at http://community.databricks.com
Most of the datafiles are available at the location mentioned in the lab notes with the exception of the Criteo click through rate data.  You need to visit the Criteo site directly and fill out some forms before being able to download
